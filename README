How To Use The Library
======================
To get started, load up data using the classes in the data namespace.
You want to load into DataItems. After that, you want to make groups out of them.  There are two types of groups provided, and you can use the grouper helper class to generate groups, or make your own, or inherit the class and make your own groups that way. After that, you will use the dataview.simple.simpledataviewgenerator class to make a hierarchy. Alternatly, you can create superclasses of the hierarchy classes to create your own customized one.
